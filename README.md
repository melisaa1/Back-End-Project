## 🗄️ Database & ORM

* **Database:** SQLite
* **ORM:** Entity Framework Core (Code First)

The database schema is created and managed using **EF Core Migrations**.
A SQLite database is used for persistence, managed via Entity Framework Core.


---

## 🔐 Authentication & Authorization

Authentication is implemented using **JWT Bearer Tokens**.

### Authentication Flow

**Register**

```http
POST /api/auth/register
```

**Login**

```http
POST /api/auth/login
```

After successful login, a JWT token is returned.

### Token Usage

The token must be included in the `Authorization` header for all protected endpoints:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>
```

Unauthorized requests are automatically rejected by the API.
